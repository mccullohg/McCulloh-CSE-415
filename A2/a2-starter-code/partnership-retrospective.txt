Assignment 2, Part 2

For this assignment, I worked with Arnav Khera. Arnav completed the AStar code,
and I created and implemented the Heuristic search functions. We met twice throughout
this process to discuss code, results, and to decide who would take which part of 
the project. Both partners are satisfied with the amount of work done by each other.
